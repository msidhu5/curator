# Manpreet Sidhu - Curator 

# Instructions to run:
- npm install (on frontend, backend, and main folder)
- npm start (on main folder)

# API's
- I used the Spotify API for this project: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

# Notes 
- My MongoDB database stopped letting me connect without me changing any of my code, so I made a 
new project on MongoDB and it is working again. I'm not sure what happened but I figured 
i'd make a note here in case it happens when you all go to test it. 

- Sometimes activities and playlists take a bit to show up so you might need to 
refresh the page for those to properly show up. I added a note on the actual webpage 
as a reminder.

- The project version that is on gitlab opens up at localhost:3000 initially,
but once you sign in it will redirect to my deployed app. I was unsure how to get 
it to initially deploy to the url below but it seems to work either way.

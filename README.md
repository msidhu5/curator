# Manpreet Sidhu - Curator 

# Instructions to run:
- npm install (on frontend, backend, and main folder)
- npm start (on main folder)

# API's
- I used the Spotify API for this project: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

# Notes 
- Sometimes activities and playlists take a bit to show up so you might need to 
refresh the page for those to properly show up. I added a note on the actual webpage 
as a reminder.
